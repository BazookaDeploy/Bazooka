# Configure your first application

To be able to deploy an application you must first configure Bazooka. The first thing to do is to select **Applications** from the **Admin** dropdown.

From there select **Create new Application** and insert the chosen name in the dialog then click **Create**.

Once this is done, by clicking on the application name, you can go to the enviroments list, where you can configure all the enviroments where your application will be deployed.

Create a new enviroment by clicking on the **create** button and give it a name.

Once created by clicking on it you can configure the specific enviroment. As you can see there are three tabs:

- Tasks, which will allow you to add all the tasks that will compose your deploy
- Permissions, which will let manage deploy permissions
- Hooks where you can obtain the url to launch a deploy from anoter application

To complete your first configuration simpli create a new task for the deploy by clicking **new** and then **Deploy task**. By filling all the required data and clicking **create** you will have created your first configuration.
