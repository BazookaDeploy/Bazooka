# Permissions

Bazooka adopts a restrictive handling of permissions meaning that anything that has not been explicitedly permitted is denied. This means that by default only the user that has configured an application is able to deploy it.

Obviously this is not terribly useful so you can give the authorization to other users or to a group of users to deploy a specific application in a specific enviroment.

To do this simply enter the application administration section, select your application and the desired enviroment. Once the enviroment is selected you can select the **Permissions** tab and add a User or a group of user   to thos who are authorized to deploy the application.
